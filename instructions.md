- using the <GameControls/> component, create a game with five rounds
- In each round, at the top left corner of the page show a text that shows the player the current game round "1/5" like so.
- Additionally, keep store of the roundScore and display it at the top right corner of the page after each round of the game.
- When each round starts, there should be a countDown component that counts down the time the player has to arrange the cards correctly, this time should be "30 seconds", so sarting from 30 to 0.
-
- In each round of the game, a player is shown a page with the <GameControls/> and a player has to move the event cards to match with the year displayed at the bottom.
- Once they have arranged the cards in the order they think is correct, they will click on a button that says "lock In"
- When the "lock In" button is clicked, they will be redirected to /roundscore page
- In /roundscore page they will be shown <GameControls/> with the right order of the event cards to the year from oldest to latest year.
- In /roundscore page they will also be shown how much score they got for that specific round
- There five cards to arrange so players will be awarded 200 points for each year they matched to the event card but they also get 0 to 100 point for how quickly they lock in their answer in the 30 seconds game time window.
- Lastly, when it is the last round, instead of a "Lock In" button, there will be a "Final Score" button.
- When the "Final Score" button is clicked, they will be redirected to /finalscore page where they are shown the finalScore which is the sum of the score from each roundScore.
- On the /finalscore page, there should also be a button that says "play again"
- if the "Play Again" button is clicked, the game is reset and a new round will be started again.
- For the game you should keep a global state of the roundScore, finalScore, guessOrder for each round, and the correctOrder of the cards.
